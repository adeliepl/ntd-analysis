# The Battle Against Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in the WHO Africa Region (2010-2021)

## Overview
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) affect over **1 billion people** worldwide, disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable populations. This project analyzes **WHO data from 2010-2021** to uncover trends, disparities, and insights into the battle against NTDs in the Africa region.

## Dataset
- **Source:** World Health Organization (WHO)
- **Period Covered:** 2010 - 2021
- **Key Variables:**
  - `Location`: Country or region
  - `Period`: Year
  - `FactValueNumeric`: Number of reported NTD cases

## Methodology
This project follows a structured data analysis approach:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing values and duplicates.
   - Converting necessary columns to numerical format.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Statistical analysis (mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation).
   - Trend analysis of NTD cases over time.
3. **Geographic Disparity Analysis:**
   - Identifying top and bottom countries based on NTD prevalence.
   - Visualizing case distribution across regions.
4. **Visualization:**
   - Line graphs for NTD trends over time.
   - Bar charts ranking countries by case counts.

## Key Findings
- The **NTD case range** varies drastically, from 0 to **147,555,654 cases** in a single region.
- A **gradual decline in NTD cases** in recent years suggests the impact of healthcare interventions.
- Stark **geographic disparities** highlight the need for targeted strategies in highly affected regions.
- The most common recorded case count was **zero**, indicating that many areas successfully reduced or eliminated NTDs.

## How to Run the Analysis
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the following libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Script
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/ntd-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ntd-analysis
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Results & Visuals
Some of the key visualizations include:
- **Trend of NTD Cases (2010-2021)** – A line graph showcasing the overall decline.
- **Top & Bottom Countries by NTD Cases** – Bar charts illustrating disparity in burden.

## Future Work
- Integrate **socio-economic factors** to better understand NTD prevalence.
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict future NTD trends.
- Expand the dataset to include **intervention program effectiveness**.
